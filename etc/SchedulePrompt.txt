I have four rooms, titled "King", "Hawk", "Jones Dance", and "Art Gallery".
I want to schedule them on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
Each Day should have its own table in the spreadsheet.
For each day, I want the columns to have the room names, and the rows to have the times.
I want the available room+time-slots to have open space of 5 lines so that anyone can fill in that slot, via their phone through the web.
