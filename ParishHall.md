## Parish Hall Times for the Winter Tech Forum Conference

These are the actual times we will be using it; should allow probably 1/2 hour before and a few minutes after each time slot.

Traditionally we use both the upstairs and the downstairs room (however, we accomodate previously reserved weekly activities in the downstairs room).
