# The Winter Tech Forum Hugo Static Site Source
Hugo Static Site for the [Winter Tech Forum Conference](www.WinterTechForum.com).

Because of the theme, the site automatically works well on phones as well as computers and tablets.

Everything is in markdown so it's very easy to add/edit content. If you look at the "content" subdirectory you'll see how straightforward it is to add new pages.

I think this will also make it easier to clone/set up new conferences.

I'm still coming up the curve on static site generators in general and Hugo in particular so if anyone knows more please feel free to make suggestions and/or pull requests.
