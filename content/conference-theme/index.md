Theme: *TBA*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   (Topics here)
-   And lots more
-   Plus anything else anyone wants to talk about, of course
-   And our business track

Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn't
preclude session topics that might be considered "off theme." The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.

Wednesday Hackathon
-------------------

Hackathons typically explore new technologies or even create new product
prototypes. Past hackathons have ranged from hardware projects to the
exploration of new languages, and some have focused on a particular product or
technology. If you can get a group together that wants to explore a topic, go
for it.

Hackathons take place in either the conference venue or the various houses
that are rented by groups in town. The evening of the hackathon, results are
presented in the *Hackathon Showcase Lightning Talks*.
