Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn't
preclude session topics that might be considered "off theme." The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.

Resilience and Recovery
-----------------------

How do we keep our systems from failing, and how do we recover from failures when they happen?

- The challenges in gaining adoption for better error handling.
- Problems with throwing exceptions. Using exceptions without throwing them.
- The functional approach (return a monad containing the result together with
  error information).
- Challenges using the functional approach with languages that don't directly
  support it.
- Using type systems to produce more robust code.
- Guaranteeing that exception handlers are tested.
- The Erlang/Elixir approach of letting subsystems crash and restarting.
- The state of testing.
- Plus anything else anyone wants to talk about, of course.
- And our business track.
