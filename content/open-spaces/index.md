What's the best thing that happened at the last conference you attended? It's
very likely you'll remember one or more "hallway conversations," or perhaps a
"Birds-Of-A-Feather" session. An Open Spaces conference creates that experience
*for the entire conference*, by ensuring that you are always having the most
interesting **conversation** possible. The emphasis is on *discussion*, instead
of listening to eyes-forward presentations.

Open Spaces is a simple methodology to create a self-organizing conference.
It relies on participation by people who have a passion for the topics
to be discussed. There is no preplanned list of topics, only time slots
and a space in the main meeting room where interested participants
propose topics and pick time slots.

Open Spaces conferences have also been called *Unconferences*.

Open Spaces have been used for conferences and as a facilitation technique
for company meetings, community organizations, and other groups that
wish to explore the emergent ideas and agendas of their members. I have
organized a number of Open Spaces events which have been far and away the
best meeting experiences I've ever had (I think I'd put on Open Spaces
all the time if I could).

Prepare to be surprised by the depth and breadth of topics that are
discussed in Open Spaces. Each Open Space experience is unique in some way.
Quite often topics are raised in Open Spaces that are off the radar of the
original meeting — this spontaneity is part of the benefit.

Some people have found this concept to be intimidating. In particular,
questions like the following may arise:

-   *Can I contribute anything of value?*
-   *Do I need to come with some kind of prepared presentation?*

It doesn't matter if you contribute a little or a lot. And you'll probably
discover that you know things that others do not. Everyone has something to
give, whether they know it or not — even if it's the "beginner's mind" that
asks the right questions.

One of the greatest things about an Open Space is that it's spontaneous. It's
not about traditional "eyes-forward" presentations, so if you go to the trouble
of creating a formal presentation, it's likely it won't get used. On the other
hand, if you are familiar with some technology that others might like to learn
about, we might end up asking you to show us. But not in a formal way. So all
you really need to bring is your brain.

Open Spaces Guidelines
----------------------

Open Spaces is a small set of guidelines that allow groups of people to
interact and connect in a simple, productive, organized way, creating valuable
dialogs that address the participants' most important issues.

The fundamental guidelines of the sessions that happen during Open Spaces
conferences are:

-   Whoever shows up is the right group.
-   Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
-   Whenever it starts is the right time.
-   When it's over, it's over.

The *Law of Two Feet*
---------------------

If you feel you are not contributing or benefiting from a presentation, please
feel free to move on to something else:

-   Move to another open spaces session.
-   Start a conversation with someone.
-   Go to one of the nearby coffee places; often there are other attendees there in
    spontaneous conversation.
-   Post notes from a session. There are folks who couldn't make it who would love
    to know what's happening.
-   Take a walk, or a nap.

In an Open Spaces conference it is decidedly *not* rude to get up and leave
(although it might take awhile for you to get used to doing it). On the
contrary, if you are in a session and disengaged, you are sucking energy out
of the room — in that case you're actually helping by using the law of two
feet.

To Lead an Open Spaces Discussion
---------------------------------

-   Come up with an interesting topic and title for your discussion.\
    *You don't need to be knowledgeable on the topic, just interested in having
    a discussion about it*.\
    *Most of the ideas will
    come to you during the event so you don't need to think of them ahead of time*.

-   Fill out a Post-It for your topic. Put your name on it so people know who to
    talk to about it.

-   Place the topic on the schedule.

-   If you see topics that have something in common, consider combining them
    into a single time slot by talking to the convener of the other topic(s).

-   If a significant number of people want to attend both your discussion and
    another discussion in the same time slot, try to trade into another time
    slot to ensure maximum dialog and participation.

To Attend an Open Spaces Discussion
-----------------------------------

-   Check the board and just show up. It's OK to drop in once the discussion
    starts.

-   Use the **Law of two feet** if the session isn't doing it for you.

-   Allow the discussion convener to steer the topic.\
    *If you have a different perspective that needs a full time slot,
    feel free to add your own Open Space slot to discuss the topic.*

Invert Your Participation Mode
------------------------------

Open Spaces are about participation. Your natural mode might be to participate,
or it might be to sit back and listen. Regardless of your natural mode, you
will benefit hugely if you make an effort to invert it.

### If You Naturally Participate

As someone who often presents to groups, I find it easy to slip into lecturing
mode. I resist this impulse, because that's not what Open Spaces are about.
General things to remember:

-   This is a discussion, and you learn more in an Open Space from listening
    than by talking (*You have two ears, but only one mouth*).

-   If you're used to lecturing, pretend you're in the audience.

-   Let go and let it happen. It will.

-   Try not to control the conversation (if you're the convener of the session,
    "steering" is OK).

-   When you *do* speak, know your audience and don't talk down to them. If
    people need clarification, they will ask for it.

-   Just say it; try not to use the entertaining embellishments (like those you
    might for public speaking). The other participants are smart enough to get
    it unadorned.

-   If you find yourself writing notes or flipcharts beforehand, step back and
    take a breath. You're probably preparing a lecture. You'll learn that it's
    far more interesting to let the conversation unfold on its own.

-   If you absolutely must give an introduction, make it no longer than 5
    minutes, and note it on the session announcement so that people can choose
    not to come until the discussion starts. If it's longer than 5 minutes,
    this probably isn't the right forum.

If you're in a session and a lecturer needs help stopping, raise your hand and
say "I'd like to hear what everyone else has to say about this."

### If You Naturally Sit Back and Listen

-   Try to participate, even if you think you don't have anything to
    contribute. People are often surprised to discover they know something that
    others want to understand.

-   Ask questions if someone talks about a topic you don't understand. This
    conference is about information sharing. People are not intentionally
    trying to be obtuse if they use an acronym or talk about a topic as if
    everyone knows it. Not only will you learn the most if you say "I don't
    know what that is," you'll often find that others don't know either and
    will appreciate you asking the question. The person who brought up the
    topic will be glad to explain it — we're not in a hurry to get through some
    arbitrary amount of information.
