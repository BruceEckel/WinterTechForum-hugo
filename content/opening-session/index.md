weight: 160

- Open Spaces: creating discussion
  - Post-its, merging similar sessions, moving sessions around
  - Law of two feet
  - Law of two ears and one mouth
  - Invert your participation mode
  - It's OK to try any experiment via post-it. Like Julie's request for help on python.
    Even if only one person shows up you'll have an experience. If no one shows up,
    you might have scheduled it against something that people really wanted to see,
    it doesn't mean your idea was bad.
  - Different color post it for nontechnical talks

- Afternoon sessions
  - Skiing
  - Workshops (again, be creative and bold and try experiments that might meet
    your needs. If you need it, chances are someone else will too).

- Altitude: See the "Health" page. Hyperbaric chamber, urgent care clinic at the ski area.
  Let someone know soon if you're having trouble, don't wait until it's bad. Take Ibuprofen
  if you have the slightest headache, to catch it early.

- Use Slack for everything
  - You can almost always do things with other people if you want.

- Code of conduct, contact persons

- Coworking space, wear your badge

- Lightning talks
  - No Tuesday signups until Tuesday morning, new folks have priority
  - We assume it's OK to record lightning talks for Youtube unless you say otherwise
  - Potential lightning talks thursday after progressive dinner, before Karaoke

- Hackathon day
  - Tuesday after lightning talks: form groups and decide where to meet

- Yurt dinner Friday: Is there anyone not coming, so I can tell the caterer?

- Dinner: My house is available for group dinners; I'll often do that.
  The Wooden Nickel is an expensive tourist trap. I have a personal grudge
  against Elk Avenue Prime. Sunflower is the best place in town, followed by
  Django's; I haven't been to Soupcon in a long time (expensive) so I'm not
  sure if it's still as good.

- Lunch: we recommend Momo's, Teocalli Tamale for good and fast. Also the Last
  Steep, Ryce and Pita's in Paradise. The Gas Cafe makes good hamburgers.

- Game nights: announce if a game might be offensive, law of two feet.

- Progressive Dinner and Karaoke

- Saturday breakfast
