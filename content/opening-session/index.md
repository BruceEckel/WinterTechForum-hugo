- These notes can be found under "opening" at the bottom of the WTF site sidebar

- Wifi password

- Open Spaces: creating discussion
  - Post-its, merging similar sessions, moving sessions around
  - The online board is the "single point of truth"
  - Law of two feet: If you're thinking it'll be over soon...
  - Law of two ears and one mouth
  - Invert your participation mode
  - Butterflies (social connectors) and bumblebees (idea pollinators).
  - Eyes forward conference presentation is about the happy path. We talk about problems and challenges
  - It's OK to try any experiment via post-it. Example: one person requested help on python.
    Even if only one person shows up you'll have an experience. If no one shows up,
    you might have scheduled it against something that people really
    wanted to attend&mdash;it doesn't mean your idea was bad.

- Afternoon sessions
  - Skiing, etc
  - Workshops (again, be creative and bold and try experiments that might meet
    your needs. If you need it, chances are someone else will too).

- Center for the Arts
  - We want to leave a good impression with the center so we can keep using this great building
  - We are cleaning up after ourselves
  - Storage closets
  - We can't bring alcohol into the building (big fine)
  - Take off shoes for Jones Dance Room

- Altitude: See the [Health](/health) page.
  - The Fountain for IVs, Hyperbaric chamber in Gunnison, urgent care clinic at the ski area.
  - Let someone know soon if you're having trouble, don't wait until it's bad.

  - You can almost always do things with other people if you want.

- Code of conduct, contact persons
  - Pronouns and whether photos are ok on your badge
