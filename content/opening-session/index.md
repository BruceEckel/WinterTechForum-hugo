# Notes for Introductory Session

- Pronouns and whether photos are ok
- Law of two ears and one mouth
- Group picture on day one?
- Game nights: announce if a game might be offensive, law of two feet.
- No Tuesday signups lightning talks until Tuesday morning, new folks have priority
- Initial meeting Wednesday hackday (Tuesday after lightning)
- Butterflies and bumblebees, if you're thinking it'll be over soon
- Private feedback, public reflection
- Would you be interested in some difficult feedback?
- Explicit permission to take care of yourself. Law of two feet writ large.
- Different color post it for nontechnical talks
- It's OK to try any experiment via post it. Like a Kickstarter. Like Julie's request for help on python.
- Eyes forward conference presentation is about the happy path. We talk about problems and challenges
- Record lightning talks
- Badge hanger so people don't worry about forgetting badges
