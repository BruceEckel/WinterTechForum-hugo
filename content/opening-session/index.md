- Open Spaces: creating discussion
  - Post-its, merging similar sessions, moving sessions around
  - Please update the online board
  - Law of two feet
  - Law of two ears and one mouth
  - Invert your participation mode
  - It's OK to try any experiment via post-it. Example: one person requested help on python.
    Even if only one person shows up you'll have an experience. If no one shows up,
    you might have scheduled it against something that people really 
    wanted to attend&mdash;it doesn't mean your idea was bad.

- Afternoon sessions
  - Skiing
  - Workshops (again, be creative and bold and try experiments that might meet
    your needs. If you need it, chances are someone else will too).

- Altitude: See the "Health" page. Hyperbaric chamber, urgent care clinic at the ski area.
  Let someone know soon if you're having trouble, don't wait until it's bad. Take Ibuprofen
  if you have the slightest headache, to catch it early.

- Alcohol and other things.

- Use Slack for everything
  - You can almost always do things with other people if you want.

- Code of conduct, contact persons

- Coworking space, wear your badge

- Lightning talks
  - No Tuesday signups until Tuesday morning, new folks have priority
  - We assume it's OK to record lightning talks for Youtube unless you say otherwise
  - Potential lightning talks Thursday after progressive dinner

- Hackathon day
  - Tuesday after lightning talks: form groups and decide where to meet

- Yurt dinner Friday. I need to tell the caterer:
  - Is there anyone not coming?
  - Number of Vegetarians
  - Dietary restrictions (she's going to make most everything gluten free)

- Dinner: My house is available for group dinners; I'll often do that. The
Wooden Nickel is an expensive tourist trap. I have a personal grudge against
Elk Avenue Prime. Sunflower is the best place in town, followed by Django's; I
haven't been to Soupcon in a long time (expensive) so I'm not sure if it's
still as good. The Coal Creek Grill is rumored to be very good these days (and
has breakfast). The Last Steep is reliable.

- Lunch: we recommend Momo's, Teocalli Tamale for good and fast. Also the Last
Steep, Ryce and Pita's in Paradise. The Gas Cafe makes good hamburgers.
Breakfast & Lunch at McGill's is good.

- Game nights: announce if a game might be offensive, law of two feet.

- Progressive Dinner

- Saturday breakfast
