Crested Butte is a small resort town located at about 9000 feet, near
the continental divide. It is known for its skiing in the winter and
hiking and mountain biking in the summer.

We hold the event in town, and free buses run up to the ski mountain
every 15 minutes.

Try to stay downtown and not on the mountain, so you can just walk everywhere.
See <a href = "/lodging">Lodging</a> for details.

High-speed Internet is available in the conference location and at
several locations within easy walking distance of the conference
location. Most lodgings provide Internet access but you should ask to
make sure.

**Restaurants:**
[This](http://www.downtowncrestedbutte.com/restaurants-in-crested-butte/)
is a reasonably accurate list. There are also a few restaurants on the
mountain.

**Often people stay the day after the conference or for the weekend;
informal gatherings have been known to happen.**
