Crested Butte is a small resort town located at about 9000 feet, near
the continental divide. It is known for its skiing in the winter and
hiking and mountain biking in the summer.

We hold the event in town, and free buses run up to the ski mountain
every 15 minutes.

[This site](http://www.downtowncrestedbutte.com/) is probably the most
well-maintained reference to hotels and restaurants in downtown Crested
Butte (where we hold the event -- note that you should try to stay
downtown and not on the mountain, so you can just walk everywhere). Note
that site only lists hotel-style lodging; there is also a [very nice
hostel](http://www.cbhostel.com/), and numerous AirB&B's and VRBO-style
spaces available.

High-speed Internet is available in the conference location and at
several locations within easy walking distance of the conference
location. Many lodgings provide Internet access but you should ask to
make sure.

**Restaurants:**
[This](http://www.downtowncrestedbutte.com/restaurants-in-crested-butte/)
is a reasonably accurate list. There are also a few restaurants on the
mountain, including the popular [Django's](http://djangos.us/).

**Often people stay the day after the conference or for the weekend;
informal gatherings have been known to happen.**

[Here's another site](http://travelcrestedbutte.com/) about travel,
lodging and the Crested Butte experience.
