**Pre-conference**: If you arrive early, post something on Slack. If I or others
are around and available, we might be able to come out for meals or other
activities.

**Post-conference**: Often people stay the day after the conference or for the
weekend; informal gatherings have been known to happen.

**Developer Retreat**: This year there will a multi-day post-conference
Developer Retreat, held at [Evolve Coworking](https://www.evolvework.co/).
Registration for the conference includes the developer retreat. There is no
theme; you work on your projects of interest and we discuss them during breaks
and meals.

Sunday 6:00pm
-------------

Welcome Potluck Barbeque at Bruce's House (107 WhiteRock). Bring something
to grill, cook, or share. There will be food, so if you're hopeless in the
kitchen, just bring beer.

Go to the corner of First and WhiteRock, and you'll see a building of four
townhomes with solar panels on the roof. My unit is the furthest away from
the corner, and you'll see a little white cargo trailer in front. I usually
have colorful lights on, as well.
