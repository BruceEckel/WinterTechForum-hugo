**Pre-conference**: If you arrive early, post something on Slack. If I or others
are around and available, we might be able to come out for meals or other
activities.

**Post-conference**: Often people stay the day after the conference or for the
weekend; informal gatherings have been known to happen.

**Developer Retreat**: This year there will a multi-day post-conference
Developer Retreat, held at [Evolve Coworking](https://www.evolvework.co/).
Registration for the conference includes the developer retreat. There is no
theme; you work on your projects of interest and we discuss them during breaks
and meals.

Sunday 6:00pm
-------------

Welcome Potluck Barbeque at Bruce's House (107 WhiteRock). Bring something
to grill, cook, or share.

Go to the corner of First and WhiteRock, and you'll see a building of four
townhomes with solar panels on the roof. My unit is the furthest away from
the corner, and you'll see a little white cargo trailer in front. I usually
have colorful lights on, as well.
