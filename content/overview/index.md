- *I wanted to let you know how much I thoroughly enjoyed the week I spent in Crested Butte for the WTF conference. Thanks for helping to organize such a wonderful conference and bringing together such a great group of people. It was exciting to see how a group left unto themselves, can self organise and set out on a meaningful course. This spirit of the event really resonated with me and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey thoughout the year.* -- Will Mooney

- *The WTF took me to places I never imagined I would go; intellectually, emotionally, career-wise, and geographically. The power of this tiny thing is immeasurable.* -- Andrew Harmel-Law, Tech Principal at ThoughtWorks, Author of [Facilitating Software Architecture](https://a.co/d/1axwWc4)

- *I'm still stunned by how impactful WTF is ... each year I walk away with a sense of knowing what I need to focus on that will help make an impact on my team and our projects.* -- Matt Brandt, Mozilla

- *The roundup has been the best and most transformative conference of my life, by far. It's directly responsible for getting me where I am.* -- Joe Sondow

- *In my experience, the open-spaces forums that Bruce has facilitated have been a great source of new ideas, new friends in the tech world, and a fresh source of inspiration and energy I could apply to my regular work.* -- Joel Neely
