### Group Houses

One of the most popular things to do for conferences is to rent houses
together. This might or might not be cheaper, but it's generally more fun and
a nicer experience. It also adds an additional workspace for the retreat.

Make sure you add yourself to the newsgroup for the conference, so you can
make arrangements with other attendees to rent houses. Usually one person
finds the house, and then others come and fill it up.

There's a brand new collection of short-term lodgings in town. They are one block away from the beautifully updated Clark's Market, and a couple of blocks from the Parish Hall:

Pricey, but very nice and with different room options (I saw one room with 4 bunk beds) so the prices could be different depending on the fanciness of the sleeping situation you choose.

### Other Lodging

There are many AirBnB locations available; again, try for *Crested Butte*, not
*Mount Crested Butte*.

Crested Butte has a number of hotels, varying from OK to nice, none of which
are chains. Make sure you check the (albeit outdated in some places) [details
about lodging and how to get to Crested
Butte](http://mindview.net/Seminars/Locations/CrestedButte/CrestedButte.html).

If you're in a hurry you can just call the Crested Butte Chamber of
Commerce at (800) 545-4505 and they will help you make a reservation.
Remember to ask for a reservation *in the town of Crested Butte*, and
not on the mountain, in order to be close to the conference location.
However, in the Summer there are always more rooms available on the
mountain than in town, and the bus runs every 15 minutes between the
mountain and town.

If you're on a budget, try the [hostel](http://cbhostel.com/) or ask the
Chamber of Commerce about camping.
