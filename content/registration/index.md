*Price does not include skiing, which is optional. For beginners, ski
instruction can be arranged. There is also cross-country skiing
(cheaper), snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.*

Step 1:
-------

Request to join the [Conference
Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/JavaPosseRoundup) (called "Java Posse
Roundup" for historical reasons).

You can post questions to the newsgroup, arrange ride sharing, group house
rentals, etc.

Make sure you use the email address where you would like to receive information
about the conference. That is, use the attendee's address and not an admin's
address.

**NOTE:** This address will not be used for anything except the conference.

Step 2:
