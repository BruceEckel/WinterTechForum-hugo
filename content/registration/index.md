*Price includes the multi-day developer retreat that occurs directly
after the conference, at [Evolve Coworking](https://www.evolvework.co/).*

Step 1:
-------

Request to join the [Conference
Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/JavaPosseRoundup) (called "Java Posse

General announcements are made through the newsgroup.

Make sure you use the email address where you would like to receive information
about the conference. That is, use the attendee's address and not an admin's
address.

**NOTE:** This address will not be used for anything except the conference.

Step 2:
-------

Join the Winter Tech Forum Slack channel (instructions in the welcome message for the conference newsgroup).

You can post questions to the Slack channel, arrange ride sharing, group house
rentals, etc.
