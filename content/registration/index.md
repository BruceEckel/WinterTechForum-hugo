*Price includes the multi-day developer retreat that occurs directly
after the conference, at [Evolve Coworking](https://www.evolvework.co/).*

*Price does not include skiing, which is optional. For beginners, ski
instruction can be arranged. There is also cross-country skiing
(cheaper), snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.*

<!-- Step 1:
-------

Join the [Conference
Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/JavaPosseRoundup) (called "Java
Posse Roundup" for historical reasons). General announcements are made through
the newsgroup. Make sure you use the email address where you would like to
receive information about the conference. That is, use the attendee's address
and not an admin's address. **This address will not be used for anything
except the conference.** -->

Step 1:
-------

Join the [Winter Tech Forum Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/wtfconf/shared_invite/enQtNDk5MjUyMTc4MjkxLWUzMjkxNDM1MGM3MDU2MDJhYTRlODY5MjljOWNlYmQyMmNkMGRmMzlhMWE1ZmQ4NmIyY2JmODhkNWI0NDIyM2Y).
You can post questions to the Slack channel, arrange ride sharing, group house
rentals, etc.
