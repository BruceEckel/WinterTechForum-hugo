*Price does not include skiing, which is optional. For beginners, ski
instruction can be arranged. There is also cross-country skiing
(cheaper), snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.*

- REGISTER EARLY: This helps us plan

<!-- - REGISTER EARLY: We have 30 reservations for the Friday night Yurt dinner
  (ski/snowshoe to the Yurt for a catered dinner). Everything for this (including equipment and ski pass) is included in the conference fee.
  However, unused tickets must be released on February 12.
  You can still register at the last minute, but if you wait until then you
  will not have a Yurt dinner.
  Details [here](https://cbnordic.org/things-to-do/magic-meadows-yurt/yurt-dinners/). -->

<!-- Step 1:
-------

Join the [Conference
Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/JavaPosseRoundup) (called "Java
Posse Roundup" for historical reasons). General announcements are made through
the newsgroup. Make sure you use the email address where you would like to
receive information about the conference. That is, use the attendee's address
and not an admin's address. **This address will not be used for anything
except the conference.** -->

Step 1
-------

Join the [Winter Tech Forum Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/wtfconf/shared_invite/enQtNDk5MjUyMTc4MjkxLWUzMjkxNDM1MGM3MDU2MDJhYTRlODY5MjljOWNlYmQyMmNkMGRmMzlhMWE1ZmQ4NmIyY2JmODhkNWI0NDIyM2Y).
You can post questions to the Slack channel, arrange ride sharing, group house
rentals, etc.
