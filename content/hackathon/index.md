On Wednesday, we take a break from discussions and run a one-day hackathon.
Hackathons typically explore new technologies or even create new product
prototypes. Past hackathons have ranged from hardware projects to the
exploration of new languages, and some have focused on a particular product or
technology.

All you need is a group that wants to explore a topic. You'll probably start
forming groups on Monday and Tuesday, as you discover other people's interests.

The Parish Hall is unavailable during the day, until 8pm. Hackathon projects
take place in rental houses, at Bruce's house, or at [Evolve
Coworking](https://www.evolvework.co/).

The evening of the hackathon, results are presented in the *Hackathon Showcase
Lightning Talks* at 8pm at the Parish Hall.

- Hackathon presentations are **limited to 10 minutes.**
