Most people find this the best---and most unusual---conference experience of their life.
The reason?
Our primary goal is connection and participation.

We don't have lectures.
Instead, we create discussions.
If there's something you want to talk about, chances are other people want to talk about it too.
Put it on the board!

Sound crazy?
Can't possibly work?
We've been doing events like this for 25 years, and the biggest (and best) complaint we get is, "I can't go to all the sessions!"

We also call it a *retreat*.
Afternoons are open time that people use for going outside, or just relaxing.
Afternoon workshops spontaneously form, usually to more deeply explore a technology.
People go out to lunch and dinner together or make meals in the rental houses, and we have evening activities: lightning talks, hackday presentations, the popular progressive dinner, and the Friday banquet.
There are games in the rental houses, and spontaneous conversations always happen.
From waking to falling into bed, you are only bored if you want to be.

Sound exhausting?
Traditional conferences often are, but most people come away recharged.
And that's our aim, that you leave full of energy!

## Understanding the Conference

We do our best to provide information via two primary sources:

1. [The web site](https://www.wintertechforum.com/)
2. [The WTF Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wtfconf/shared_invite/zt-303widqu9-3n_LHLFmm6IvZygHpXLoiQ)

If you can't find the information on the web site, ask on Slack; It's full of friendly folks who have attended before.
Slack is also where we communicate during the conference, for pretty much everything.
If you can't get the answers you need, you can always reply to this email.
