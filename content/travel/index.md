## The Cheapest Way (On Your Own)

1.  Fly to Denver airport on a discount airline like Southwest, arriving with
    enough time to get to the bus. (Denver is a Southwest hub, so you can usually
    get a nonstop flight there). Before buying your airline ticket, make sure the
    return timing for the bus works.

1. Take the [Light Rail from Denver Airport to Union Station](https://www.denver.org/about-denver/transportation/airport-rail/).

1. Take the [Bus from Union Station to Gunnison](https://webstore.trailways.com/buy-bus-tickets/denver-co-to-gunnison-co). You should buy your ticket online, when you make your airline reservation.

1. Get off at the [Powerstop Gas Station & Cafe](http://www.the-powerstop.com/).

1. Travel the rest of the way to Crested Butte via Alpine Express (you'll need
to make a reservation ahead of time). "We typically pick up passengers at the
Powerstop bus stop and bring them to where they are staying at in Crested
Butte. The cost is $37.53 one way per adult or $68.38 roundtrip for most
addresses." From the [Alpine Express home
page](http://alpineexpressshuttle.com), click on "Reservations," then, below
"Gunnison/Crested Butte Airport to/from Crested Butte," select either "Adult
Round Trip" or "Adult One Way." Put in the date, the bus arrival time under
"flight arrival time", and put "Powerstop" in the space labeled "Name of
Hotel/Condo or Lodging Address." You can leave the rest of the fields alone.
Alpine Express will email you a confirmation. If you need to you can also
contact them: <info@alpineexpressshuttle.com>.


## The Cheapest Way (With Others)
-   Denver is a hub for Southwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines, so you can usually
    get an inexpensive nonstop flight.
-   Rent a car from Denver. If you're a Costco member, their
    [car rental service](https://www.costcotravel.com/Rental-Cars) is exceptional.
-   Use the mailing list to find others to share your car rental.


## Flying into Gunnison
-   This is often the fastest, and most expensive, option.
-   Alpine Express takes you from the Gunnison airport to Crested Butte.
-   Because of weather, the Gunnison flight can be unreliable.

## Other alternatives
-   There are coaches that can be rented for groups, to take you to Crested Butte
-   Montrose airport (about an hour further away than Gunnison) can sometimes be more
    reliable than Gunnison. There are services to bring you from Montrose to Crested
    Butte, or you can rent a car.
