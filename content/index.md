- *I'm still stunned by how impactful WTF is ... each year I walk away with a sense of knowing what I need to focus on that will help make an impact on my team and our projects.* -- Matt Brandt, Mozilla

- *The roundup has been the best and most transformative conference of my life, by far. It's directly responsible for getting me where I am.* -- Joe Sondow

- *In my experience, the open-spaces forums that Bruce has facilitated have been a great source of new ideas, new friends in the tech world, and a fresh source of inspiration and energy I could apply to my regular work.* -- Joel Neely
