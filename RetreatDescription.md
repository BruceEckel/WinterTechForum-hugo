We intentionally don't plan because we've found that it's nice not to have any constraints.

We start with breakfast, and discussions often trend toward technology. Sometimes people decide to try things out. 

Different people try different things, often in subgroups. Sometimes people want to do something outside like a bike ride or hike.

We make it up as we go, and it works really well that way.

People may need to work remotely, come earlier or later, take a lot of naps (it's a retreat), etc. It all works.
